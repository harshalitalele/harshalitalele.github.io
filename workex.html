                <div class="project">
                    &gt; Developed a JavaScript framework of a web application to display map-like tile based medical slide images on the basis of schema generated by the microscopic slide scanners
                </div>
                <div class="project">
                    &gt; Developed an annotation library on top of another library in plain JavaScript language which acts like a plugin to let  ser draw and save different types of annotations on the ‘Deep  zoomable’ medical images. These annotations are saved in  mathematical model in the database and are converted into the geometric figures on front end. And these figures do zoom and  an along with the base image.

                <div class="project">
                    &gt; Developed a drawing tool (a different approach than above mentioned annotations) which uses HTML5 Canvas features to  display auto generated huge number of annotations on Deep zoomable Images. These can be modified and stored in the form of tiled images so as to train machines again later.
                </div>
                <div class="project">
                    &gt; Developed several other features on top of the web application to support ‘Remote Sharing’ of the image with central repository of tiled images. And only mouse gestures are shared among the participants and accordingly zooming and panning of the images are performed and controls are shared on the client sides.
